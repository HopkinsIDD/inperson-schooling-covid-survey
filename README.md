Code is provided to reproduce the primary in-person schooling (`1-Primary-Schooling-Analysis.Rmd`) and occupation/work outside home (`2-EducatorAnalysis.Rmd`) analyses using a synthetic dataset. Hence, **results produced when knitting the documents in this repository will not match those presented in the accompanying paper.** 

Data to reproduce paper figures/tables are freely available from the CMU Delphi Research Group to researchers at universities and non-profits as detailed at Getting Data Access - Delphi Epidata API (cmu-delphi.github.io). Results for the full data are presented in `1-Primary-Schooling-Analysis-full.Rmd`, `2-EducatorAnalysis-full.Rmd`, and `tables/`.
